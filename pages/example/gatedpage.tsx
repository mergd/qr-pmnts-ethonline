						To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Bitcoin.
						Its future applications are extremely subtle, and without a solid
						grasp of computing and economics most of its possible functions will
						go over a typical investor&apos;s head.

						<br /> There&apos;s also Sitoshis&apos;s free market outlook, which
						is deftly woven into his creation- his personal philosophy draws
						heavily from Robert Malthus, for instance. The shills understand
						this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate
						the depths of this coin, to realise that it is not just speculation
						- it says something deep about LIFE. <br />
						As a consequence people who dislike Bitcoin truly ARE idiots- of
						course they wouldn&apos;t appreciate, for instance, the brilliance
						in Satoshi&apos;s brilliant programming method - the ‚ÄúBlockchain,‚Äù
						which itself is a cryptic reference to Haber and Stornetta&apos;s
						Merkle trees. <br />

						I&apos;m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated
						simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as our lord and
						savior&apos;s genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens.
						What fools.. how I pity them. üòÇ And yes, by the way, i DO have a
						Bitcoin tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It&apos;s for the
						ladies&apos; eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that
						they&apos;re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower)
						beforehand. Nothin personnel kid üòé
